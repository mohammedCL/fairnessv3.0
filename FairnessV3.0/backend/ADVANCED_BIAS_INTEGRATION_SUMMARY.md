# Advanced Bias Detection Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the advanced bias detection methods from `number_of_biased_features.py` into `analysis_service.py`. The integration maintains the original functionality while adapting it to the analysis service architecture.

## Integrated Components

### 1. Advanced Bias Detection Methods
- **Direct Bias Analysis**: Chi-square statistical testing between sensitive attributes and target variables
- **Proxy Feature Detection**: Identifies features that can indirectly predict sensitive attributes
- **Feature-Level Analysis**: Individual feature bias assessment with correlation, mutual information, and prediction tests

### 2. Comprehensive Statistical Testing
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Distribution differences between groups for numerical features
- **Mann-Whitney U Test**: Non-parametric test for group differences
- **Chi-square Test**: Independence testing for categorical features
- **Pearson Correlation**: Linear relationship assessment
- **Mutual Information**: Non-linear dependency measurement

### 3. Multi-Sensitive Attribute Analysis
- **Individual Analysis**: Separate analysis for each sensitive attribute
- **Cross-Attribute Analysis**: Interaction effects between multiple sensitive attributes
- **Combined Bias Assessment**: Holistic view of bias across multiple dimensions

## Implementation Details

### New Classes Added
1. **AdvancedBiasDetection**: Main class containing all advanced methods
   - `direct_bias_analysis()`: Direct statistical bias testing
   - `detect_proxy_features()`: Proxy feature identification
   - `comprehensive_statistical_testing()`: Multi-test statistical analysis
   - `model_based_bias_testing()`: ML model fairness assessment
   - `multi_sensitive_attribute_analysis()`: Cross-attribute bias analysis

## Test Results

### Test Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: 1,000 samples with 8 features
- **Sensitive Attributes**: Gender, Race, Region
- **Target**: Loan approval (binary classification)
- **Known Biases**: Intentionally biased dataset for testing

### Detection Results
- **Direct Bias**: ✅ Detected significant bias in gender (p<0.001) and race (p<0.001)
