## Available Mitigation Strategies

### Preprocessing Strategies
These strategies modify the training data before model training:

1. **Data Reweighing**
   - Reweights training samples to balance sensitive groups
   - Ideal for: Datasets with imbalanced sensitive groups
   - Pros: Addresses bias at the source, works with any model
   - Cons: May lose important information

2. **Disparate Impact Remover**
   - Removes features that cause disparate impact
   - Ideal for: When direct discrimination through features is suspected
   - Pros: Eliminates direct discrimination pathways
   - Cons: May remove useful predictive features

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - Augments underrepresented groups with synthetic data
   - Ideal for: Small datasets with underrepresented groups
   - Pros: Increases representation of minority groups
   - Cons: Synthetic data may not reflect real patterns

### In-processing Strategies
These strategies integrate fairness constraints during model training:

4. **Fairness Regularization**
   - Adds fairness penalty to model training objective
   - Ideal for: When you can retrain the model with fairness constraints
   - Pros: Integrates fairness into model optimization
   - Cons: Requires model retraining

5. **Adversarial Debiasing**
   - Uses adversarial training to remove bias
   - Ideal for: Complex models where traditional methods fail
   - Pros: Can handle complex bias patterns
   - Cons: More complex to implement and tune

### Post-processing Strategies
These strategies adjust model predictions to achieve fairness:

6. **Threshold Optimization**
   - Optimizes decision thresholds for each sensitive group
   - Ideal for: When model retraining is not possible
   - Pros: Works with existing models, quick to implement
   - Cons: May hurt overall model performance

7. **Calibration Adjustment**
   - Calibrates predictions to ensure fairness across groups
   - Ideal for: Probability-based models with calibration issues
   - Pros: Ensures prediction probabilities are fair
   - Cons: May affect prediction confidence

8. **Equalized Odds Post-processing**
   - Adjusts predictions to achieve equalized odds across groups
   - Ideal for: When equalized odds is the primary fairness goal
   - Pros: Directly optimizes for equalized odds
   - Cons: May not address other fairness metrics

## How to Use

### Backend API

#### 1. Start Comprehensive Mitigation
```bash
POST /api/mitigation/comprehensive/start
{
    "analysis_job_id": "your_analysis_job_id"
}
```

#### 2. Monitor Progress
```bash
GET /api/mitigation/comprehensive/job/{job_id}
```

#### 3. Get Results
```bash
GET /api/mitigation/comprehensive/results/{job_id}
```

### Frontend Integration

```tsx
import BiasManagement from './components/BiasManagement/BiasManagement';
import ComprehensiveMitigationResults from './components/ComprehensiveMitigationResults/ComprehensiveMitigationResults';

// Start mitigation
<BiasManagement 
  analysisJobId="your_analysis_job_id"
  onBack={() => setCurrentView('analysis')}
/>

// View results
<ComprehensiveMitigationResults 
  jobId="mitigation_job_id"
  onBack={() => setCurrentView('mitigation')}
/>
```

## Results Format

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test to verify the system:

```bash
cd backend
python test_comprehensive_mitigation.py
```

1. Create a synthetic biased dataset
2. Train a biased model
3. Apply all mitigation strategies
4. Display comprehensive results
5. Test API endpoints

## Performance Considerations

### Execution Time
- **Total Time**: Typically 15-30 seconds for standard datasets
- **Strategy Variations**: Preprocessing (fast), In-processing (medium), Post-processing (fast)
- **Dataset Size Impact**: Larger datasets take longer, especially for preprocessing strategies

### Memory Usage
- **Model Copies**: Each strategy creates a new model copy
- **Data Transformations**: Preprocessing strategies may increase data size
- **Recommendation**: Ensure sufficient memory for 8+ model instances

### Scalability
- **Parallel Processing**: Strategies are applied sequentially (can be parallelized)
- **Batch Processing**: Support for multiple analysis jobs
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary models

## Best Practices

### 1. Strategy Selection
- **Start Comprehensive**: Always run comprehensive analysis first
- **Focus on Top 3**: Consider top 3 performing strategies for production
- **Domain Considerations**: Consider domain-specific requirements

### 2. Performance Trade-offs
- **Monitor Accuracy**: Check if fairness improvements hurt model performance
- **Business Context**: Consider business impact of fairness vs. accuracy
- **Iterative Approach**: Try combinations of strategies if needed

### 3. Production Deployment
- **Validate Results**: Test selected strategy on hold-out data
- **Monitor Drift**: Regularly re-evaluate fairness in production
- **Document Decisions**: Record which strategy was chosen and why

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Strategy Failures**
   - Some strategies may fail due to data characteristics
   - Check error messages in execution summary
   - Try individual strategies to isolate issues

2. **Low Improvement Scores**
   - May indicate fundamental data bias issues
   - Consider data collection improvements
   - Try preprocessing strategies first

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Trade-off between fairness and accuracy is normal
   - Consider post-processing if accuracy is critical
   - Evaluate business impact of performance changes

### Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- **Strategy-level errors**: Individual strategy failures don't stop the process
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues with remaining strategies
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive error reporting and logging
